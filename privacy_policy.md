Financial institutions like CC Mutual, LLC and our affiliates and subsidiaries (collectively “CC Mutual,” “we,” or “us”) may be required to provide privacy policy notices when we hold personal information relating to individuals, as defined below (“Personal Information”).  We believe that protecting the privacy of Personal Information is of the utmost importance. It is our policy to safeguard the privacy, confidentiality and security of Personal Information and to comply with the applicable data protection laws, including SEC Regulation S-P and state regulations pertaining to Personal Information.  It is also our policy to process Personal Information in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (the “GDPR”) where applicable. We process Personal Information lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to you and ensure that the Personal Information which we process is relevant, accurate and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed, and that Personal Information is kept confidential.
